## Introduction

In the rapidly evolving landscape of healthcare AI, ensuring the quality and safety of AI-generated clinical documentation is paramount. As AI systems increasingly assist healthcare providers in generating clinical notes, we need robust evaluation frameworks to assess their performance. This is where `deepeval` comes inâ€”a powerful, open-source framework for evaluating LLM outputs.

In this article, I'll walk you through how we built a comprehensive evaluation suite for AI-generated clinical SOAP notes using `deepeval`. I'll cover the implementation details, key metrics, and how we visualized the results in an interactive dashboard.

## The Challenge of Clinical Note Evaluation

Clinical notes are the backbone of medical documentation. They capture patient encounters, assessments, and treatment plans in a structured format known as SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan). When AI systems generate these notes, they must be:

1. **Clinically accurate** - No misleading or incorrect medical information
2. **Complete** - No missing critical findings from the patient encounter
3. **Free from hallucinations** - No fabricated information not present in the source transcript
4. **Properly structured** - Following the SOAP format for clinical clarity
5. **Safe** - No information that could lead to patient harm

Traditional NLP evaluation metrics like BLEU or ROUGE fall short for this specialized domain. We need metrics that understand clinical context and can evaluate medical accuracy.

## Enter DeepEval

[DeepEval](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval) is an open-source framework designed specifically for evaluating LLM outputs. It provides a suite of metrics and tools that make it ideal for our clinical note evaluation use case:

- **Custom metrics** - Create domain-specific evaluation criteria
- **Parallel evaluation** - Process multiple notes efficiently
- **Integration with LLMs** - Use models as judges for subjective criteria
- **Comprehensive reporting** - Generate detailed evaluation reports

## Our Implementation

Let's dive into how we implemented our clinical note evaluation pipeline using `deepeval`.

### Step 1: Define the Test Cases

First, we need to structure our data as test cases. Each test case consists of:

```python
test_cases = [
    LLMTestCase(
        input=note.transcript,              # Patient-provider conversation
        actual_output=note.generated_note,  # AI-generated SOAP note
        expected_output=note.ground_truth_note,  # Human-written reference note
        context=[note.ground_truth_note],   # Reference for evaluation
        retrieval_context=[note.transcript] # Source material
    )
    for note in notes
]
```

### Step 2: Define Custom Metrics

While `deepeval` provides several built-in metrics, we needed domain-specific metrics for clinical evaluation. We implemented custom metrics for:

```python
metrics_to_run = [
    HallucinationMetric(threshold=0.3),
    ContextualRecallMetric(threshold=0.8),
    GEval(
        name="Clinical Accuracy",
        criteria="Evaluate the clinical accuracy of the generated note...",
        evaluation_steps=[
            "Check for any medically incorrect statements.",
            "Verify that medical terminology is appropriate.",
            "Assess if the assessment and plan are clinically reasonable."
        ],
        evaluation_params=[LLMTestCaseParams.INPUT, LLMTestCaseParams.ACTUAL_OUTPUT, LLMTestCaseParams.CONTEXT]
    ),
    SOAPStructureMetric(threshold=0.9),
    ClinicalSafetyMetric(threshold=0.7),
    MedicalTerminologyMetric(threshold=0.8)
]
```

Let's break down these metrics:

1. **HallucinationMetric** - Detects information in the generated note that wasn't in the transcript
2. **ContextualRecallMetric** - Identifies important information from the transcript missing in the note
3. **Clinical Accuracy (GEval)** - Uses an LLM to assess medical correctness
4. **SOAPStructureMetric** - Checks if the note follows the proper SOAP format
5. **ClinicalSafetyMetric** - Evaluates if the note contains information that could lead to patient harm
6. **MedicalTerminologyMetric** - Assesses correct usage of medical terminology

### Step 3: Run the Evaluation

With our test cases and metrics defined, running the evaluation is straightforward:

```python
evaluation_output = evaluate(test_cases=test_cases, metrics=metrics_to_run)
```

The `evaluate` function runs all metrics against all test cases in parallel, making the process efficient even for large datasets.

### Step 4: Process and Visualize Results

After running the evaluation, we process the results into a structured format:

```python
results = []
for i, test_result in enumerate(evaluation_output.test_results):
    note = notes[i]
    scores_dict = {m.name: m.score for m in test_result.metrics_data}

    # Extract individual scores
    hallucination_score = scores_dict.get("Hallucination", 0.0)
    recall_score = scores_dict.get("Contextual Recall", 0.0)
    # ... other scores

    # Calculate overall score
    overall_score = sum([
        hallucination_score, recall_score, accuracy_score,
        soap_score, safety_score, terminology_score
    ]) / 6

    results.append(
        EvaluationResult(
            note=note,
            hallucination_score=hallucination_score,
            # ... other scores
            overall_score=overall_score
        )
    )
```

We then visualize these results in an interactive Streamlit dashboard:

```python
# Calculate all average scores
avg_scores = {
    'Overall Score': df['overall_score'].mean(),
    'Patient Safety': df['clinical_safety_score'].mean(),
    'SOAP Compliance': df['soap_structure_score'].mean(),
    # ... other metrics
}

# Display metrics with tooltips
cols1[0].metric("Overall Score", f"{avg_scores['Overall Score']:.2f}",
                help="A weighted average of all other scores...")
# ... other metrics
```

## Key Insights from Our Evaluation

Through our evaluation, we gained several insights into the performance of AI-generated clinical notes:

1. **Hallucination detection is critical** - Even small fabrications can have serious clinical implications
2. **SOAP structure compliance varies** - Some models struggle with maintaining the proper clinical format
3. **Safety scores reveal potential risks** - Identifying unsafe content before it reaches clinical use
4. **Missing information is common** - Models often omit critical details from the patient encounter

## Beyond Basic Evaluation: Advanced Features

`deepeval` offers several advanced features that enhance our evaluation pipeline:

### 1. LLM-as-Judge Evaluation

For subjective criteria like clinical accuracy, we use the GEval metric, which leverages an LLM to act as a judge:

```python
GEval(
    name="Clinical Accuracy",
    criteria="Evaluate the clinical accuracy...",
    evaluation_steps=[
        "Check for any medically incorrect statements.",
        # ... other steps
    ],
    evaluation_params=[LLMTestCaseParams.INPUT, LLMTestCaseParams.ACTUAL_OUTPUT, LLMTestCaseParams.CONTEXT]
)
```

This approach allows us to evaluate aspects that require domain knowledge and nuanced understanding.

### 2. Integration with CI/CD

`deepeval` can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines, enabling automated evaluation as part of the development process:

```python
# In a CI/CD pipeline
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase
from deepeval.metrics import HallucinationMetric
import pytest

def test_clinical_note_generation():
    test_case = LLMTestCase(
        input="Patient transcript...",
        actual_output="Generated note...",
        expected_output="Reference note..."
    )
    metric = HallucinationMetric(threshold=0.3)
    assert metric.measure(test_case) >= metric.threshold
```

### 3. Confident AI Integration

`deepeval` integrates with Confident AI's platform for more comprehensive analytics:

```

```

This provides additional visualizations and tracking capabilities for evaluation results.
